        <h1>What is Fake News?</h1>
        <p>
            Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as news, often with the intention to deceive or manipulate readers. 
            It spreads rapidly on social media and other platforms, blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
            <br><br>
            In a country, fake news can cause widespread misinformation, influence public opinion unfairly, incite social unrest, damage reputations, and even interfere with elections or policy decisions. 
            It threatens the credibility of legitimate media and can deeply affect national unity, safety, and democracy.
